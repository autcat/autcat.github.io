      **Categories for Automata and Language Theory @ IRIF**
      a working group

* Categorical methods have a long history in automata and language theory, but only in recent years a coherent theory has started to emerge. Among them, there are now monadic, coalgebraic, functorial, fibrational and profinite approaches to automata. The purpose of this working group is to discuss these approaches, the connections between them, and their applications to questions in automata and language theory.

* We meet generally every two weeks on **Thursday** at **13:30** in room **4071** at [IRIF](https://www.irif.fr/), bâtiment Sophie Germain, pl. Aurélie Nemours, 75013 Paris, France ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/GNZ7y45a9uqDWzea9)). See below for the precise room. A calendar of the sessions can be found [here](https://cloud.irif.fr/remote.php/dav/public-calendars/ADSGntbwqxbDANYM?export).

* To receive email announcements about future meetings, you can subscribe to our [mailing list](https://sympa.lix.polytechnique.fr/lists/info/autcat).

* [Joshua Wrigley](https://jlwrigley.github.io/): **A topos-theoretic perspective on completions of doctrines**

Abstract: Lawvere doctrines are an intuitive extension of Lindenbaum-Tarski algebras from propositional logic to predicate logic, where the role of logical quantifiers is captured by a pair of adjoint functions. 

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the field of ‘completing’ doctrines to richer syntax, e.g. Trotta’s existential completion.  We will describe a topos-theoretic framework for completing doctrines to subfragments of geometric logic.

**Room 1020**

* Serge Lechenne: A Compositional Approach to Petri Nets

  _Abstract: We define a bidirectional compositional framework for Petri nets based on a line of work about compositionally defining games and computation models. This relies on defining structures with open ends that form interfaces they can be composed along. Together with this syntactic construction, we give a graphical language of morphisms in a PROP and a semantic category that describes the evolution of markings in a Petri net. Compared to previous work, the novelty is that computations in a Petri net are stateful, requiring specific care. We give algorithms to solve reachability compositionally in this framework._
