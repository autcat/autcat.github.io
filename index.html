      **Categories for Automata and Language Theory @ IRIF**
      a working group

* Categorical methods have a long history in automata and language theory, but only in recent years a coherent theory has started to emerge. Among them, there are now monadic, coalgebraic, functorial, fibrational and profinite approaches to automata. The purpose of this working group is to discuss these approaches, the connections between them, and their applications to questions in automata and language theory.

* We meet every two weeks on **Tuesday** at **10:30** in room **1020** at [IRIF](https://www.irif.fr/), bâtiment Sophie Germain, pl. Aurélie Nemours, 75013 Paris, France ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/GNZ7y45a9uqDWzea9)).

* To receive email announcements about future meetings, you can subscribe to our [mailing list](https://sympa.lix.polytechnique.fr/lists/info/autcat).

* Serge Lechenne: A Compositional Approach to Petri Nets

  _Abstract: We define a bidirectional compositional framework for Petri nets based on a line of work about compositionally defining games and computation models. This relies on defining structures with open ends that form interfaces they can be composed along. Together with this syntactic construction, we give a graphical language of morphisms in a PROP and a semantic category that describes the evolution of markings in a Petri net. Compared to previous work, the novelty is that computations in a Petri net are stateful, requiring specific care. We give algorithms to solve reachability compositionally in this framework._
