      **Categories for Automata and Language Theory @ IRIF**
      a working group

Categorical methods have a long history in automata and language theory, but
only in recent years a coherent theory has started to emerge. Among them, there
are now monadic, coalgebraic, functorial, fibrational and profinite approaches
to automata. The purpose of this working group is to discuss these approaches,
the connections between them, and their applications to questions in automata
and language theory.

We meet every two weeks, on **Thursday at 14:00**, at [IRIF](https://www.irif.fr/),
bâtiment Sophie Germain, pl. Aurélie Nemours, 75013 Paris, France
([map](https://goo.gl/maps/GNZ7y45a9uqDWzea9)).



9 November 2023, 14h
===============================

**Room 4005**

* TBD

26 October 2023, 14h
===============================

* Discussions about organization and preparation of proposal.
* A universal property for $\epsilon$-elimination in automata.

12 October 2023, 11h30
===============================

* Unique lifting property, equidivisibility. 

28 September 2023, 14h
===============================

* The fibrational view on automata and transducers
* Direct image of regular languages under letter-to-letter morphisms are regular: is there a categorical proof?
* We made a list of topics/keywords that we might discuss at some point:
  - factorization systems and decompositions
  - higher-order specifications
  - Kleene's theorem
  - relating bifibrations of languages to opfibrations of automata
  - trees, Safra construction
  - $\mu$-calculus and MSO, and the algebras for them 
  - topological recognizers and Boolean spaces with internal monoids
